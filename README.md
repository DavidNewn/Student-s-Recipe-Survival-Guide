# My Personal Project - Student's Survival and Inspiration Recipe Cookbook
## _A recipe manager application_

## Summary List:
- **What:** A recipe cookbook or library which users can refer to for recipes and ideas.
- **Who:** College/University Students, with an interest in cooking but are inexperienced or 
  have minimal experience in cooking, and who want to reduce food waste.
- **Why:** For the past three weeks since I've arrived in Vancouver, having only studied online beforehand, 
  I've taken a great interest in cooking. Making my own meals for home and for school really engages me, and I find 
  much enjoyment in assembling ingredients I have into fully-feldge food. 
  Though I've been having difficulties sometimes in deciding on what meal to make, as well as keeping track of 
  what ingredients I have or should get without breaking bank, so this project works to tackle these issues.

### User Story/ies
__As a college/university student, I would want to do things such as...__
 - viewing a list of recipes, with recipe steps and pictures included.
 - select from a category of recipes, such as breakfast, seafood, and so on.
 - filter recipes based on my own personal preferences.
 - adding, deleting, or editing my own recipes. If I mess something up, I want to be able to revert my changes 
   or go back to default configuration.
 - saving my favourite recipes in a dedicated favourites list.
 - adding other things in a recipe which I might find useful like additional comments, ratings,
   or cost of ingredients and the meal itself (per serving?).

# My Personal Project - Student's Survival and Inspiration Recipe Cookbook
## _A recipe manager application_

## Summary List:
- **What:** A recipe cookbook or library which users can refer to for recipes and ideas.
- **Who:** College/University Students, with an interest in cooking but are inexperienced or 
  have minimal experience in cooking, and who want to reduce food waste.
- **Why:** For the past three weeks since I've arrived in Vancouver, having only studied online beforehand, 
  I've taken a great interest in cooking. Making my own meals for home and for school really engages me, and I find 
  much enjoyment in assembling ingredients I have into fully-feldge food. 
  Though I've been having difficulties sometimes in deciding on what meal to make, as well as keeping track of 
  what ingredients I have or should get without breaking bank, so this project works to tackle these issues.

### User Stories
__As a college/university student, I would want to do things such as...__
 - viewing a list of recipes, with recipe steps and pictures included.
 - filter by selecting from a category of recipes, such as breakfast, seafood, and so on.
   - also filter foods by diet, such as vegetarian, vegan, and so on 
 - adding, deleting, or editing my own recipes. Also, if I mess something up, I want to be able to revert my changes 
   or go back to default configuration.
 - saving my favourite recipes in a dedicated favourites list.
 - adding other things in a recipe which I might find useful like additional comments, ratings,
   or cost of ingredients and the meal itself (cost per ingredients and per serving for meal?).

### Additions
- make recipe book considering for many types of students: 
  - those money-conscious, those time-crunched, those who like to experiment, etc.
- have separate user accounts which have their own recipe lists
- have a meal plan schedule planner where users can plan ahead for the week, month, or anytime they so wish
- factor in time (prep+cook) and total time, considering the time-crunch student who can't invest much time in cooking
- track individual ingredients in possession
  - then perhaps also track date of purchase, best before dates, and remind me of expiration date of ingredients
  - warn the user when their ingredients for their favourite recipes are running low
- allow greater user creativity in formatting their recipes
  - allow users to edit font colours, font sizes, font styles, etc.
- weights and amount of food items
  - reasonable units depending on the food item: ml or l for liquids, # of garlic cloves
  - then also allow users to edit theses to their liking. Conversion from metric to imperial units, etc.

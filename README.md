# My Personal Project

### Summary List:
- **What:** A recipe cookbook or library which users can refer for recipes and ideas for new meals
- **Who:** College/University Students, with an interest in cooking but are inexperienced or 
  have minimal experience in cooking, and who want to reduce food waste.
- **Why:** For the past three weeks since I've arrived in Vancouver, having only studied online beforehand, 
  I've taken a great interest in cooking. Making my own meals for home and for school really engages me, and I find 
  much enjoyment in assembling ingredients I have into fully-feldge food. 
  Though I've been having difficulties sometimes in deciding on what meal to make, as well as keeping track of 
  what ingredients I have or should get without breaking bank, so this project works to tackle these issues.
